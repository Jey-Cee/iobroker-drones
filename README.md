The AIM of this module is to control Linux and Windows devices via ioBroker.

*Note:* Support for Apple, Android and likely other operating systems is within the future scope as well.

Goal of this module is also to replace ioBroker's [Windows Control Adapter](https://github.com/Mic-M/ioBroker.windows-control) by a reliable, slim, open source, secure and scalable solution, and to get rid of the "GetAdmin.exe" tool dependence.

This module is in an early development phase; please stay tuned and follow our progress.
